    transcript: "So, you think you can't start a business without a pocket full of cash, huh? Heh, listen here, kid... you don't need a fortune, just a sharp mind and a spine of steel. I've seen people rise from nothing but the dirt under their nails. Don't you ever let money be an excuse. If you're hungry enough, if you've got the guts, you'll find a way. Stick with me, and I'll show you how to claw your way to the top without spending a king's ransom. But remember... this isn't a game. You either move with purpose, or you don't move at all.",

    setting: "The old man is standing at the edge of a crumbling city street, the backdrop a city that has seen hard times. It symbolizes struggle and the grit needed to rise above it. Dusty, worn signs of shops hang in the distance. He's ready to talk about fighting against the odds."

    transcript: "Your first customers won't come knocking at your door, kid. You gotta hunt 'em down. Talk to people. Real people. Not behind some fancy screen, but face to face. Eyes locked, intentions clear. Everybody's looking for solutions to their problems. Your job? Find out what keeps 'em up at night and show 'em how you fix it. Simple as that. No fancy marketing campaigns, no throwing money at billboards. Just pure, honest value. Remember, a satisfied customer doesn't just pay your billsâ€”they bring you more customers. Treat 'em right, and they'll do your marketing for you.",

    transcript: "Listen up. Most businesses don't fail 'cause their idea was bad. They fail 'cause they bleed money on things they don't need. You want fancy offices? Expensive equipment? Save it for when you're actually turning a profit. Start in your garage. Use what you've got. Barter. Trade skills. You need to stretch every dollar until it screams for mercy. And for heaven's sake, don't quit your day job until your business can actually feed you. Pride doesn't pay the bills, kid. Survival first, luxury later.",
